# Introduction

Initially, my objective was to find answers to my questions about the French language. This work resulted in six 96-page notebooks containing these answers. Facing certain recent challenges, I decided to digitize all of this content. The result is this comprehensive work on French grammar, including both answers and necessary explanations.

Although the first three notebooks were initially written in English, this book is entirely in French, as linguistic immersion remains the best approach to mastering a language. An English version will be available later, within approximately one to four months.

This work covers nearly all grammatical concepts in French. Once these principles are mastered, you will be able to write your own texts in French if you wish. The level progresses in a logical order, beginning with simple questions I asked at the start of my learning journey, evolving toward advanced grammatical concepts that not all learners will find necessary. You are therefore free to select the sections that correspond to your needs.

This book was primarily designed for my personal use, to have a structured digital version of my notes that I could easily consult. Remember that approximately 50% of language learning relies on repetition.

The book was created using [MdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), a tool I had always wanted to use and for which I finally found a practical application.
